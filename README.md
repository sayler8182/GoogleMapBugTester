Google Maps iOS continous spinner for navigation

----------------------

Sample app that opens Google Maps in walking mode to some location :

`comgooglemaps://?daddr=56.674676171943425,12.852880892572248&center=56.674676171943425,12.852880892572248&directionsmode=walking`

When Google Maps is killed the spinner is continous visible and map is not loaded properly but when GoogleMaps runs in background it works like a charm.

The same result is when You open this link in Safari browser on iPhone.
